        <h2>About Me</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p> Full-stack web developer with a background in Mathematics, Graphic Design and Account Consultation. Recently
        graduated a certificate program in Full Stack Development from the University of Central Florida, focused on
        skills in jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design to merge with prior skills in Microsoft
        Office branches, data entry, and Paint Tool SAI. Professional strengths include problem solving, teamwork,
        adaptability and a drive for learning through market-appropriate out-of-the-box creativity. When faced with the
        options of the road less traveled or the common easy route I’ve found myself to explore the woods.</p>
        <p>   I live by and evolved from a counterculture bridging the world of the ‘Normal’ with that of the ‘Unique’ (sometimes Eccentric).
        Reading between the lines of what we think we know, I aim to be a force challenging myself and my field to
        anticipate and meet the market’s current and future needs. Everything can be solved, it only takes time, passion,
        creativity and attention to the details involved to translate or manipulate whichever rules you’re working with.</p>
